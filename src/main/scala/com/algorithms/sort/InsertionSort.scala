   * print sortedArr  // prints Array(1,3,4,5,6)
   *
   *
   * @param arr an array of integers
   * @return the same array in sorted in place. we could just return Unit here and use the original array.

  /**
   * This is a more functional approach to insertion sort. We are using immutable lists so we will copy the elements
   * to a second list, which is returned. The rational is simple:
   * We will traverse all the elements in the original list and all them in a sorted list. To do that we are using
   * foldLeft. foldLeft takes an empty list and an insert function and adds the elements in the correct order in the
   * List.
   * Insert function has three cases:
   *  * if the compare function is true (e.g. the element in the list is bigger than the item to be inserted) then it
   *    inserts the item in front of that portion of the list (since all the rest items are bigger).
   *  * if the compare function is false then it continues to the next part of the list
   *  * if we reached the end of the list or the list is empty, just add the item there (e.g. it is bigger than the rest
   *    of the items already in the list).
   * @param compf the compare function. the first parameter is the existing item in the list and the second is the item
   *              to be inserted
   * @param lst   the unsorted list
   * @tparam T    type of items e.g. Int
   * @return      a sorted List[T]
